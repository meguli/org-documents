On an org file belonging to my project, I just execute /M-x org-publish-all/ and
HTML output, which is the one I care, appears in my /~/public_html/ directory.
Of course, to make this work, I have to add following to my /.emacs/ file

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(require 'ox-publish)
(setq org-publish-project-alist
      '(
		("org-notes"
			:base-directory "~/org/"
			:base-extension "org"
			:publishing-directory "~/public_html/"
			:recursive t
			:publishing-function org-html-publish-to-html
			:headline-levels 4             ; Just the default for this project.
			:auto-preamble t
		)
		("org-static"
			:base-directory "~/org/"
			:base-extension "css\\|js\\|php\\|jpg\\|png"
			:publishing-directory "~/public_html/"
			:recursive t
			:publishing-function org-publish-attachment
		)
		("org" :components ("org-notes" "org-static"))
	))
#+END_SRC

In reality, it is also quite easy to also produce LaTeX documents from my org setup.
Just call /M-x org-latex-export-to-pdf/ and you are good to go. Still, you might have
to tweak your settings to get the look and feel you want. Mine is heavily focused
on HTML output.

Now that all my website lives under /~/public_html/, it is just a matter of setting
up a Github pages repo pointing to this directory and pushing to remote as things 
change.

There is truth, my boy. But the doctrine you desire, absolute perfect dogma 
that alone provides wisdom, does not exist. Nor should you long for a perfect 
doctrine, my friend rather, you should long for perfection in yourself. The 
deity is within you, not in ideas and books. Truth is lived not taught.

/tufte-css/ is the CSS part of the Edward Tufte inspired typesetting efforts, 
you can find their demo easily on the web. We are going to use parts of it in 
our documents. In fact, epigraph above is an example of it. Here is how we 
embed it.

Basically, we organize things in a way that "epigraph" HTML class will be filled 
with /blockquote/ HTML tags. Our modified /tufte-css/ file will handle the rest 
for us. Other strong feature of Tufte documents are margin notes. On the left, 
at the beginning of the page, you should see a margin note about 
/Fundamental Theorem of Calculus./ The way to add this again similar to other 
custom /begin - end/ environments.

and note that you can add source code, latex, figures etc. into your margin notes
just by nesting environments. Since it is too important to use screen space, 
including margins, effectively in Tufte's style, we have another method of adding
a figure called /fullwidth/ figure. This spans the entire screen. Below you can
see a /fullwidth/ figure;

#+BEGIN_fullwidth
#+LABEL: fig:fullwidth
#+CAPTION: A full width data table
[[file:./img/tufte-full.png]]
#+END_fullwidth

and to add this, as you can guess by now, we do;

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
#+BEGIN_fullwidth
#+LABEL: fig:fullwidth
#+CAPTION: A full width data table
[[file:./img/tufte-full.png]]
#+END_fullwidth
#+END_EXAMPLE

Some of the figures and sources used in this chapter are taken from 
cite:RMarkdown2018 and cite:Tufte2001, amazing set of typesetting and note taking
resources they are.

Let's first talk about how to include a link in a document. Here is
an example [[https://www.google.com][link]]. This can be inserted using

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE 
[[https://www.google.com][link]]
#+END_EXAMPLE

Since I am a programmer, I think I should next talk about including
source code listings in a document. Org-mode has environments for
various things and we will also talk later about creating our own
environments. For source code, we will use /src/ environments. This
looks like 

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
#+BEGIN_SRC 
.. SOURCE CODE GOES HERE
#+END_SRC
#+END_EXAMPLE

We will follow with an example listing so that you can see. Note
that syntax highlighting depends on /htmlize/ library and you can
install this with MELPA package manager of emacs. It should come
bundled with newer versions of org-mode though.

#+BEGIN_SRC c
int main()
{
    return 0;
}
#+END_SRC

These environments we are talking about are also called /special
blocks/. Another special block is an example block which I am using
above as 

#+BEGIN_SRC
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE 
[[https://www.google.com][link]]
#+END_EXAMPLE
#+END_SRC

when I first talked about links. The next thing we need to be able to
add into our document is math of course. We will depend on MathJax
for this and it is actually really easy with org-mode.

label:Eq-1.1
\begin{align}
\mathcal{F}(a) &= \frac{1}{2\pi i}\oint_\gamma \frac{f(z)}{z - a}\,dz\\
\int_D (\nabla\cdot \mathcal{F})\,dV &=\int_{\partial D}\mathcal{F}\cdot n\, dS
\end{align}

we just drop our equations as if we are creating $\LaTeX$ documents.
I use following header at /main.org/ to achieve this.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
#+HTML_MATHJAX: path: <path-to-MathJax-CDN>
#+HTML_MATHJAX: align: left indent: 5em tagside: left font: Neo-Euler
#+END_EXAMPLE

Another thing is to adding figures and images.

#+LABEL: fig:maxwell
#+CAPTION: Demo Picture with Caption
[[file:./img/maxwell.jpg]] 

and this is how to add it

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
#+LABEL: fig:maxwell
#+CAPTION: Demo Picture with Caption
[[file:./img/maxwell.jpg]]
#+END_EXAMPLE

I put all my images under /./img/ directory relative to the project
I am working on. We can refer to this image in any place of the
text using [[fig:maxwell][a link]] by saying

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
[[fig:maxwell][a link]
#+END_EXAMPLE

It is also possible to embed Youtube videos. First, we have to add following 
to our /.emacs/ file.

#+BEGIN_SRC 
(defvar yt-iframe-format
  ;; You may want to change your width and height.
  (concat "<iframe width=\"440\""
          " height=\"335\""
          " src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/%s\""
          " frameborder=\"0\""
          " allowfullscreen>%s</iframe>"))

(org-add-link-type
 "yt"
 (lambda (handle)
   (browse-url
    (concat "https://www.youtube.com/embed/"
            handle)))
 (lambda (path desc backend)
   (cl-case backend
     (html (format yt-iframe-format
                   path (or desc "")))
     (latex (format "\href{%s}{%s}"
                    path (or desc "video"))))))
#+END_SRC

Then, add youtube videos using

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
[[yt:PZwDTB4-zNQ]]
#+END_EXAMPLE

where /PZwDTB4-zNQ/ is the video part of a youtube link. Resulting video looks
like the one below

[[yt:PZwDTB4-zNQ]]

Another important thing is being able to cite other people's work
and we need to install an emacs package called /org-ref/ to achieve
this and require it in our /.emacs/ file.  org-ref will let us achieve more
than just citations. It is also useful in referencing the parts of our documents 
like the equation above.

Now we can cite like cite:Shifrin2004. 

Note that I can recall and refer to a past equation as ref:Eq-1.1.
And we can put labels and refs to any part of the text. Here is the
part in the file where we does this.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
First, we put label:Eq-1.1 to the top of our LaTeX equation.
We can cite like cite:Shifrin2004. 

Note that I can recall and refer to a past equation as ref:Eq-1.1.
#+END_EXAMPLE

We can also use org-ref for keeping an index but that is for $\LaTeX$
exports. You can look into that if you are interested.

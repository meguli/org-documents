For the first blog post on this site, I am just going to salute you.
Also, I want this blog post to act as a tutorial for me on what to
publish and how to publish it using org-mode. On this [][repo] where I
keep my /~/org/ folder basically, you can see a directory called
/blog/. This have a directory structure like 

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  |---blog
  |   |-- ./2018
  |   |-- index.org
  |   |-- additional_files...
  |   |-- ...
  |   |-- ...
  |   |-- a dir for each year
#+END_EXAMPLE

I write a blog post as an org file. This post's file lies in dir
/2018/, as an example. In the main /index.org/ file, I basically
link a blog post after I write one. This becomes /index.html/ 
when I call /org-publish/.

To celebrate, let me also share with you a piece of music that I
have been listening to a lot lately. This is microtonal jazz by
Philipp Gerschlauer. I don't know how he is playing the sax in
that tuning but it is great.
